The word communication arises from the Latin word ‘commūnicāre’, which means “to share”. 

Communication can be basically defined step for exchange of information. 

In the fastest growing of the communication industry, wireless communication technology has rapidly developed. 

With this development, necessities of requirement for higher data rates and so enlarging demand on band are arisen. 

Due to capacity requirements, different type of techniques are tried and applied. OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Domain Multiplexing) resolves these needs in communication technologies.

It is  seen as either a modulation technique or a multiplexing technique in literature 

This technology has been developed for wideband digital communication, and used for encoding of digital signal of multiple carrier frequencies. 

In this technique, data is carried with orthogonal sub-carrier signals with different frequencies. 

Audio broadcasting, DSL Internet Access, Wireless Networks, and in 4G mobile communication systems are using OFDM method.


Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) extends the concept of single carrier modulation by using multiple subcarriers within the same single channel.

The evolution of OFDM can be defined as a combination of Frequency Domain Multiplexing (FDM) and Multi-Carrier Modulation/Communication (MCM).
